[Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) is an open-source code editor built with the web for the web.

You can hide your sidebar using **View->Hide Sidebar** Or **Ctrl+Shift+H**. But it is little hard, if you want to access it immediatley. This extension will help you to access sidebar when you HOVER at the left end.

You can see this [youtube](http://youtu.be/NpVFG7rqXXM) video for demo.

Please post issues and feature changes/requests. I will try to improve this.
